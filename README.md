RAGAs is a framework designed to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It provides tools to assess RAG models by evaluating the retrieval and generative components, both separately and together. The goal is to ensure that these systems are performing well in both retrieving relevant information and generating accurate and relevant answers.

## Overview

RAGAs was originally designed for "reference-free" evaluation, meaning it doesnâ€™t require human-annotated ground truth labels. Instead, it leverages large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the pipeline's output. This reduces costs and speeds up the evaluation process. However, there is some ongoing research into the challenges of this approach, such as bias. Despite that, early studies have shown promising results.

While RAGAs initially focused on reference-free evaluation, it has expanded to include metrics that rely on human-annotated ground truth labels, such as context recall.

## Evaluation Requirements

To evaluate a RAG pipeline using RAGAs, you will need the following inputs:

- **Question**: The input query from the user.
- **Answer**: The generated response from the RAG pipeline.
- **Contexts**: The external knowledge sources that were retrieved to answer the question.
- **Ground Truth**: The correct, human-annotated answer (required for context recall).

## Metrics for Evaluation

RAGAs provides a variety of metrics that help in evaluating the RAG pipeline at both the component and pipeline levels.

### Component-Level Metrics

- **Context Precision**: Measures the quality of the retrieved contexts in relation to the question, reflecting how much useful information was retrieved.
  
- **Context Recall**: Measures if all the relevant information needed to answer the question was retrieved. This requires human-annotated ground truth labels.

- **Faithfulness**: Evaluates how factually accurate the generated answer is. It checks the number of correct statements based on the provided contexts.

- **Answer Relevancy**: Measures how relevant the generated answer is to the user's question. If an answer only addresses part of the query, it will have low relevancy.

### End-to-End Metrics

- **Answer Semantic Similarity**: Compares the generated answer to the expected one to measure how semantically close they are.

- **Answer Correctness**: Measures if the generated answer is factually correct.

### Range of Metrics

All the metrics provided by RAGAs are scaled between 0 and 1, where higher values represent better performance.

## Key Features

- **Reference-Free Evaluation**: Uses LLMs instead of human-annotated data, reducing manual work and speeding up evaluations.
  
- **Ground Truth Support**: Provides metrics like context recall and answer correctness, which do require human-annotated ground truth labels.

- **Automatic Test Data Generation**: Tools are included for generating evaluation datasets automatically.

## Research and Development

The use of LLMs for reference-free evaluation is a rapidly evolving area of research. While it brings many benefits, such as reduced human intervention, there are challenges like biases that are still being addressed.

## Installation and Usage

To get started with RAGAs, make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. Once set up, you can begin evaluating your RAG pipeline by providing the required inputs and using RAGAs to calculate the relevant metrics.
